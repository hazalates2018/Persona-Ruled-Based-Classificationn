
# Calculating Potential Customer Revenue with Rule-Based Classification




# Business Problem

# A gaming company wants to create level-based (persona) new customer profiles using certain characteristics of their customers.
# They also want to segment these profiles and estimate how much new customers might contribute on average to the company based on these segments.
# For example, the goal is to determine the average revenue that a 25-year-old male user from Turkey using an iOS device could potentially generate.

# Price: The amount spent by the customer
# Source: The type of device the customer is using
# Sex: The gender of the customer
# Country: The country of the customer
# Age: The age of the customer
